  <h2>Brief Bio: </h2>
  <p>Hey I'm Daniela Munoz, a first-year ITM major with a growing interest in cybersecurity (blue team). I'm from the East Side, Chicago, IL if you
       don't know where that is I don't blame you. The three white stripes on the city flag account for all 3 major sides (North, West, South) but
       always falls short to mention the East side. Outside of school, I enjoy biking if weather permits whether its along the lake or to one of 
       Indiana's well-kept parks. Outside of biking I enjoy completing lego sets, so far I only have an old train set, Aston Martin 007, and the
    Saturn V which has been my favourite build so far as the interior build was clean and so symmetrical. </p>
