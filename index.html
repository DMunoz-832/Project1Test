  <h2>Brief Bio: </h2>
  <p>Hey I'm Daniela Munoz, a first-year ITM major with a growing interest in cybersecurity (blue team). I'm from the East Side, Chicago, IL if you don't know where that is I don't blame you. The three white stripes on the city flag account for all 3 major sides (North, West, South) but always falls short to mention the East side. Outside of school, I enjoy biking if weather permits whether its along the lake or to one of Indiana's well-kept parks. </p>
